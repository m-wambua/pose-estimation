# Pose-Estimation #

## Prerequiste ##
### You will need to have installed Python's Open computer vision, Tensorflow, NumPy and Matplot library ##
### You can use the following line of code ###
``` pip install python-opencv tensorflow numpy matplotlib ```
### For the best experience use the note-book ###
```pose-estimation.ipynb```
### However the ### 
``` pose-estimation.py``` 
### will still work. ###

### Additionally do not alter contents of the ### ```lite-model_movenet_singlepose_lightning_3.tflite``` ### file ###
