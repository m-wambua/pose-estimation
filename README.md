# Pose-Estimation #

##Prerequiste##
### You will need to have installed Python's Open computer vision, Tensorflow, NumPy and Matplot library ##
### You can use the following line of code ###
``` pip install python-opencv tensorflow numpy matplotlib ```
### For the best experience use the note-book ###
```pose-estimation.ipynb```
### However the### ``` pose-estimation.py``` ###will still work.###
